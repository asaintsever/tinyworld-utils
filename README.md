# WorlWind Cache for TinyWorld

This repo hosts a [NASA WorldWind](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/) cache to use as a starter on any WorldWind-based application, e.g. **[TinyWorld](https://github.com/asaintsever/tinyworld)**. It helps to get first tiles, all the most if you don't have a good Internet connection.

The data is provided compressed in the [Release](https://github.com/asaintsever/tinyworld-wwj-cache/releases) section.
